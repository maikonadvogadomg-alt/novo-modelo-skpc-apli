# HTML Playground + Assistente Juridico

## Overview
This project delivers a two-in-one application: an **HTML Playground** for live code preview and an **Assistente Juridico** (Legal Assistant). The Legal Assistant is an AI-powered tool designed to process legal texts using prompts inspired by the Brazilian judicial AI system, Apoia. Its core purpose is to streamline legal document handling, analysis, and generation, aiming for enhanced efficiency and accuracy in legal operations.

The business vision is to provide a comprehensive, AI-driven solution for legal professionals, significantly reducing manual effort in document drafting, review, and analysis. This platform has the potential to capture a significant share of the legal tech market in Brazil by offering tailored features that address specific needs of the Brazilian legal system. The project ambitions include continuous improvement of AI models, integration with more judicial systems, and expansion of legal functionalities to become an indispensable tool for lawyers and legal entities.

## User Preferences
- Portuguese (BR) language for UI
- Simple, easy-to-use interface (user is not technical)
- Mobile-friendly design
- User wants results to persist (not disappear on page refresh)
- User works with large legal documents (up to 50MB)

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The application features a professional green (hsl 152) theme, suitable for legal contexts, with both light and dark modes. It is designed to be mobile-responsive, offering a seamless experience across devices. The Assistente Juridico is the main landing page, reflecting its primary importance.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: Built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui for a modern and responsive user interface. `wouter` is used for routing, and `TanStack Query` manages server state.
- **Backend**: An Express.js server handles API requests, with PostgreSQL and Drizzle ORM for data persistence.
- **AI Integration**: All AI models (Premium, Econômico, Refine) use custom/demo key when available (via `geminiStream`/`geminiStreamMessages` with `customKey/customUrl/customModel` params), falling back to Replit AI Integrations only when no user key is configured. Custom key with URL → OpenAI-compatible API (Groq, etc.); custom key without URL → direct Google Gemini API. Playground and Previdenciário also use custom keys when available.
- **Workflow Config**: The "Start application" workflow must NOT use `waitForPort` in `.replit` — removing it fixes the persistent DIDNT_OPEN_A_PORT Replit health-check failure. The server binds to 0.0.0.0:5000 and responds HTTP 200 correctly.
- **Document Processing**:
    - **Text Extraction**: `pdf-parse` (v2) for PDFs and `mammoth` for Word documents enable text extraction from various file types.
    - **OCR**: Automatic OCR for scanned PDFs using `pdftoppm` and `Tesseract` (por+eng).
    - **Transcription**: `Whisper API` and `ffmpeg` are used for audio/video transcription (MP3, WAV, M4A, MP4, MOV, .opus, .ptt, .ogg).
- **Formatting Panel**: Built-in formatting settings dialog accessible from result toolbar. User can configure: font family (Times New Roman, Arial, Courier New, Calibri), font size (10-14pt), line spacing (1-2.5), text alignment (justify/left/center/right), paragraph indent (0-4cm), citation indent (2-5cm). Settings persist in localStorage and apply to both screen display and Word export. Designed for mobile use.
- **Financial Audit Calculator**: `/auditoria` page provides a judicial sentence calculator comparing scenarios (Bank vs. Sentence) with TJMG monetary correction, BCB rates, and detailed monthly memorials. It supports Word export and PDF printing.
- **Code Assistant**: `/codigo` page — a separate AI assistant for code generation (HTML, Python, JS, etc.) that uses ONLY the user's own API key (no Replit credits). Supports preset configurations for OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Groq, Together AI, Mistral, Google Gemini, Perplexity, or any OpenAI-compatible API. Chat-style interface with streaming, history persistence in localStorage.
- **PWA Support**: The application is installable as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline capabilities.

### Feature Specifications

#### HTML Playground (`/playground`)
- Split-panel editor (HTML/CSS/JS/React/Python) with live iframe preview.
- **Real Python execution**: Uses Python 3.11 interpreter on the server (child_process), NOT AI. Zero API charges.
- **Real JavaScript execution**: Uses Node.js on the server. Zero API charges.
- Supports external CDN resources via blob URLs.
- Snippet management: save, load, delete, rename, search, and filter.
- Auto-save to `localStorage`.
- Export to `.html`, `.jsx`, `.py`, copy to clipboard.
- Editor minimization/expansion.

#### Assistente Juridico (`/`)
- **AI Actions**: Six built-in actions (Summarize, Review, Refine, Simple Language, Draft, Analyze) and support for custom AI models.
- **Document Handling**:
    - Import PDF, Word, and text files (up to 50MB, multiple files).
    - Export results as `.txt` or Word (`.docx`).
    - Document Templates with `{{CONTEUDO}}` placeholder for formatted Word exports.
    - Document selection dialog for multi-file imports.
- **AI Refinement Chat**: Multi-turn chat for refining AI results, maintaining full conversation history and context. All history is sent without truncation.
- **Jurisprudence Library**: Save, manage, and use `ementas` as AI references.
- **AI History**: Persisted history of all AI interactions, viewable and manageable. Full history (no limit) is sent as context to AI for continuity.
- **Cost Management**: Selectable models (Premium/Econômico) with cost comparison and dynamic `max_completion_tokens`. Effort slider and verbosity settings.
